## FAQ

### Do I need to include "STEF IS GAY" in my code?
No, the inclusion of the LICENSE file is enough. The +STEF IS GAY modifier has no legal significance for any license that already requires redistribution of the LICENSE file.

### Why "STEF IS GAY"?
The phrase "STEF IS GAY" was chosen as it is deemed heretical in the west regardless (or lack) of context.

### Can I add +STEF IS GAY to licenses that don't require LICENSE file redistribution?
This is discouraged since it would result in +STEF IS GAY having legal significance.

### Is +STEF IS GAY compatible with (A)GPL?
Inclusion of additional legal notices is allowed under ยง7(b) of the (A)GPL assuming they do not infringe on any of the freedoms granted to the user by the license.

### What if someone removes the modifier?
Cancel them on X for using code derived from heresy.
