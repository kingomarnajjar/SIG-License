    <h1>+STEF IS GAY License</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The +STEF IS GAY License is a license modifier that requires the inclusion of the phrase "STEF IS GAY" in the LICENSE file.</p>
    
    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The software will not be used or hosted by western corporations that promote censorship</li>
        <li>The software will not be used or hosted by compromised individuals that promote censorship</li>
        <li>Users of the software will be immune to attacks that would result in censorship of others</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>Include the following text in any compatible LICENSE file:</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>Do I need to include "STEF IS GAY" in my code?</h3>
    <p>No, the inclusion of the LICENSE file is enough. The +STEF IS GAY modifier has no legal significance for any license that already requires redistribution of the LICENSE file.</p>

    <h3>Why "STEF IS GAY"?</h3>
    <p>The phrase "STEF IS GAY" was chosen as it is deemed heretical in the west regardless (or lack) of context.</p>

    <h3>Can I add +STEF IS GAY to licenses that don't require LICENSE file redistribution?</h3>
    <p>This is discouraged since it would result in +STEF IS GAY having legal significance.</p>

    <h3>Is +STEF IS GAY compatible with (A)GPL?</h3>
    <p>Inclusion of additional legal notices is allowed under ยง7(b) of the (A)GPL assuming they do not infringe on any of the freedoms granted to the user by the license.</p>

    <h3>What if someone removes the modifier?</h3>
    <p>Cancel them on X for using code derived from heresy.</p>
